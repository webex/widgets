## Contributing
The [Widgets](https://github.com/webex/widgets) repo is a monorepo and we can utilise all the yarn workspaces commands. We have all our contact center widgets in a folder called "contact-center". 

 ### 1.	How to install dependencies?
  - Run `yarn install`
  
### 2.	How to build the Widgets?
  - Run `yarn run build`
  Additional comments
  - Each workspace has a script `build:src` which build the widget
  - @webex/cc-store needs to be build before anything.
  - yarn run build command build everything in the coorect order
  
### 3.	How to run the samples?
  For the first time if we are running samples, follow the followig steps
  - We need to ensure all the components are built before builing samples.
  - `yarn samples:build`
  - `yarn samples:serve`

### 4. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)  
- To enhance the developer experience when contributing to the widgets, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled in the React samples application. When the React samples app is running, any changes made within the repository will automatically update the application.  

#### How to Start the React Samples Application  
- `yarn install`  
- `yarn run build`  
- `yarn workspace samples-cc-react-app serve` â†’ Open `http://localhost:3000/`  
Once the application is running, any modifications made within the repository will be reflected in the samples app.  

- **Additional Notes:** Changes made to `.scss` or `.css` files will be applied immediately, whereas modifications to `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` files will trigger a full reload. It is important to be mindful of the frequency of reloads and backend registrations, as excessive reloading and initialization may result in a **429 (Too Many Requests) error**.  

**Only the React samples application supports HMR. It is recommended to use the React app for development.**  

To test web components, follow steps **1, 2, and 3** outlined above.  


## Consuming
The following section explains how external developers will consume our contact center widgets
This [Vidcast](https://app.vidcast.io/share/6276b573-ba47-4fd0-a171-16af936b69d3) shows how developers can use our widgets.

### 1.	How to install the packages?
  To install, use the following commands
- `npm i @webex/cc-widgets` (This is published, so do give this a try)
- `yarn add @webex/cc-widgets`

### 2.	How to include them in app and use? 
  We are shipping widgets as both react and web-components
  
  To use contact center widgets as **web-components**
  - Use above step to install the package
  - Create an index.js file and import the widget - `import '@webex/cc-widgets/wc'`
  - Use any bundler(webpack or rollup) to create a bundle.

  ```javascript
      <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
      <widget-cc-station-login></widget-cc-station-login>
  ```
  To use contact center widgets as **react component**
  - Install the package
  - Create an index.js file and use the widgets as follows
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import {StationLogin, UserState} from '@webex/cc-widgets';

    function App() {
      return (
        <>
		<h1>Contact Center widgets in a react app</h1>
  		<StationLogin />

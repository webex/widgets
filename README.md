## Install

```bash
npx install-peerdeps @webex/widgets
```

This will install the Widgets package, peer dependencies and dependencies.

## Usage

### Styles

In order to properly style Webex Widgets, you will need to import our CSS separately.
Import `@webex/widgets/dist/css/webex-widgets.css` into your main entry file.

There are two ways to do this:

#### JavaScript

In your `App.js[x]`, add the following import:

```js
import '@webex/widgets/dist/css/webex-widgets.css';

...
```

#### HTML

In the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`, add the following tag:

```html
<head>
  ...

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/@webex/widgets/dist/css/webex-widgets.css" />
</head>
```

For this to work, make sure that your `node_modules` folder is served.
Alternately, you may copy the CSS file to your public folder and update the link
reference accordingly.

### Widgets

Please make sure to install the [Webex Widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webex/widgets) package and related dependencies.

```bash
npx install-peerdeps @webex/widgets
```

To use a Webex Widget, simply import the desired widget and render it into your React application.

```js
import {WebexMeetingsWidget} from '@webex/widgets';

import '@webex/widgets/dist/css/webex-widgets.css';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WebexMeetingsWidget
      style={{width: "1000px", height: "500px"}} // Substitute with any arbitrary size or use `className`
      accessToken="<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      meetingDestination="<MEETING_DESTINATION>"
    />
  );
}
```

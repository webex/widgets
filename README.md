**Webex Widgets** are a set of self-contained [React](https://reactjs.org) components
that follow the [Webex](https://www.webex.com) products experience,
aimed at developers that want to embed Webex into their applications.

## Project Status

The Webex Component System is considered to be in beta stage and it's not a generally available product from Webex at this time.
This means that the Webex Component System is available for everyone to use but breaking changes may occur as we develop it.
We try our best to minimize any breaking changes but they may occur.
While the Webex Component System is not a GA product, we still offer support through all regular channels.
However, bug priority is given to product already generally available.
We love for you to use the Webex Component System and be part of the feedback process!

## Install

```bash
npm install --save webex @webex/widgets
```

Notice that the [Webex Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webex)
has to be installed as a peer dependency.

## Webex Components vs Webex Widgets

In addition to the Webex Widgets, we also offer the
[Webex Component System](https://github.com/webex/components#webex-components).
The Webex Component System (sometimes shortened as _Webex Components_) is a set of
React components that, while following Webex styling, allow for more granularity
in terms of layout and source of data.
To learn more on the Webex Component System head to its Github repository at
https://github.com/webex/components.

Webex Widgets are based on Webex Components but include the adapter that uses
our [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk) to talk to Webex services for you.
This means that the Webex Widgets use the
[SDK Component Adapter](https://github.com/webex/sdk-component-adapter#webex-sdk-component-adapter)
to inject the Webex data.
All you need is a valid access token and a few parameters based on the widget you want to use.

You have to take the Widget layout as-is, but the benefit is that there are no configurations needed.
Install, copy-paste and you have the power of Webex in your application!

## Usage

### Styles

In order to properly style Webex Widgets, you will need to import our CSS separately.
Import `@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css` into your main entry file.

There are two ways to do this:

#### JavaScript

In your `App.js[x]`, add the following import:

```js
import '@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css';

...
```

#### HTML

In the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`, add the following tag:

```html
<head>
  ...

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css" />
</head>
```

For this to work, make sure that your `node_modules` folder is served.
Alternately, you may copy the CSS file to your public folder and update the link
reference accordingly.

### Widgets

Please make sure to install the [Webex Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webex)
along with the [Webex Widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webex/widgets) package.

```bash
npm install --save webex @webex/widgets
```

To use a Webex Widget, simply import the desired widget and render it into your React application.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {WebexMeetingsWidget} from '@webex/widgets';

import '@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css';

export default function App() {
  return <WebexMeetingsWidget accessToken="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" meetingDestination="<MEETING_DESTINATION>" />;
}
```

**Webex Widgets** are a set of self-contained [React](https://reactjs.org) components
that follow the [Webex](https://www.webex.com) products experience,
aimed at developers that want to embed Webex into their applications.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save webex @webex/widgets
```

Notice that the [Webex Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webex)
has to be installed as a peer dependency.

## Webex Components vs Webex Widgets

In addition to the Webex Widgets, we also offer the
[Webex Component System](https://github.com/webex/components#webex-components).
The Webex Component System (sometimes shortened as _Webex Components_) is a set of
React components that, while following Webex styling, allow for more granularity
in terms of layout and source of data.
To learn more on the Webex Component System head to its Github repository at
https://github.com/webex/components.

Webex Widgets are based on Webex Components but include the adapter that uses
our [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk) to talk to Webex services for you.
This means that the Webex Widgets use the
[SDK Component Adapter](https://github.com/webex/sdk-component-adapter#webex-sdk-component-adapter)
to inject the Webex data.
All you need is a valid access token and a few parameters based on the widget you want to use.

You have to take the Widget layout as-is, but the benefit is that there are no configurations needed.
Install, copy-paste and you have the power of Webex in your application!

## Usage

### Styles

In order to properly style Webex Widgets, you will need to import our CSS separately.
Import `@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css` into your main entry file.

There are two ways to do this:

#### JavaScript

In your `App.js[x]`, add the following import:

```js
import '@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css';

...
```

#### HTML

In the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`, add the following tag:

```html
<head>
  ...

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css" />
</head>
```

For this to work, make sure that your `node_modules` folder is served.
Alternately, you may copy the CSS file to your public folder and update the link
reference accordingly.

### Widgets

Please make sure to install the [Webex Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webex)
along with the [Webex Widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webex/widgets) package.

```bash
npm install --save webex @webex/widgets
```

To use a Webex Widget, simply import the desired widget and render it into your React application.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {WebexMeetingWidget} from '@webex/widgets';

import '@webex/widgets/dist/webexWidgets.css';

export default function App() {
  return <WebexMeetingWidget accessToken="<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" meetingDestination="<MEETING_DESTINATION>" />;
}
```

## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make the Webex Widgets even better than they are today!
Here are some [guidelines](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that we'd like you to follow.

### Issues

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/webex/widgets/issues) and we will get to it in an orderly manner.
Please leave as much as information as possible for a better understanding.

### Contributing Code

We are using [Airbnb-style lint rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and
[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to lint the code.
Make sure your code your code follows our lint rules before submitting!

For more information on contributions, please visit
[our contributing guide](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Commit linter

We are using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to lint the commit messages.
Please make sure to choose the appropriate commit
[type](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type),
[scope](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#scope) and
[subject](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#scope).

#### Release Process

There is a list of commit types provided [here](https://github.com/webex/widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).
However, not all commits trigger our release process.
We are using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to fully automate the version management and package publishing.
By default `semantic-release` uses the
[Angular commit message conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
and triggers release and publishing based on the following rules:

| Commit                             | Release type  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Commit with type `BREAKING CHANGE` | Major release |
| Commit with type `feat`            | Minor release |
| Commit with type `fix`             | Patch release |
| Commit with type `perf`            | Patch release |

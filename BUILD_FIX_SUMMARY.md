# Build Fix Summary

## Problem

The `yarn workspace @webex/cc-components build:src` command was failing with TypeScript errors after adding the new `minimal-webex-engage-app` workspace that used Vite configuration.

## Root Cause

The main issue was a conflict between webpack and Vite build tooling configurations. The new Vite-based workspace introduced conflicting dependencies and build tool configurations that affected the existing webpack-based builds.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Build Tooling (✅ Completed)

- Created separate shared configurations:
  - `tooling/webpack/base.config.js` for webpack-based builds
  - `tooling/vite/base.config.ts` for vite-based builds
- Updated root and package-level webpack configs to use the new shared webpack config
- This prevents tooling conflicts between different build systems

### 2. Fixed Dependencies (✅ Completed)

- Added missing dependencies to `cc-components/package.json`:
  - `@react-stately/collections`
  - `@react-types/shared`

### 3. Resolved TypeScript Issues (✅ Completed)

- Updated TypeScript configuration for better React 18 compatibility
- Set `skipLibCheck: true` to avoid library compatibility issues
- Used `ts-loader` instead of `babel-loader` for more reliable TypeScript compilation
- All type exports are working correctly (verified that `MediaInfo` and `MEDIA_CHANNEL` are properly exported)

### 4. Configuration Updates (✅ Completed)

- **Root webpack.config.js**: Updated to use shared webpack configuration
- **cc-components/webpack.config.js**: Updated to use shared webpack configuration and ts-loader
- **cc-components/tsconfig.json**: Updated with React 18 compatibility settings
- **Vite config**: Created separate shared configuration for future Vite projects

## Current Status

✅ **Build is now successful** - The command `yarn workspace @webex/cc-components build:src` completes successfully with only 1 deprecation warning about Sass imports (which is non-critical).

## Build Output

- JavaScript bundles: 15.5 MiB
- TypeScript declarations: 10.6 KiB
- Assets properly generated in `dist/` directory
- No TypeScript errors
- Only 1 non-critical warning about deprecated Sass @import syntax

## Key Files Modified

1. `/tooling/webpack/base.config.js` - Shared webpack configuration
2. `/tooling/vite/base.config.ts` - Shared vite configuration
3. `/packages/contact-center/cc-components/webpack.config.js` - Package-specific webpack config
4. `/packages/contact-center/cc-components/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
5. `/packages/contact-center/cc-components/package.json` - Added missing dependencies

## Next Steps

- The build system is now properly separated and scalable
- New Vite-based projects can use the shared vite configuration
- Existing webpack-based projects continue to use the shared webpack configuration
- TypeScript errors are resolved and the build is stable

## Notes

- The separation of tooling ensures that adding new workspaces with different build systems won't affect existing builds
- All type exports are working correctly in `src/utils/index.ts` and other files
- The build performance is good with ts-loader providing reliable TypeScript compilation
